## About Me

My name is **Miriam Heiss** and I play the Organ. I am Homeschooled, and enjoy making soap!

## About the Project

My project, *Taylor Swift and Bach* will be comparing Taylor Swift and Bach on things like song length, tempo, energy, and key. I got the data from **Spotify**, but 
this is not the website it will be on. The actual project will be [**here**](https://www.miriamheiss.com/).

### Goals

* My project should show that classical music is not boring, and is just as good as popular music. 
  + This will be difficult, as classical music is slower and less energetic (on average) than popular music.
* I want my project to be informative about both popular and classical music.
